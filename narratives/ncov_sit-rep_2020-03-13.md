# Executive summary

Here, we analyzed 410</tag> publicly shared COVID-19 genomes. By comparing these viral genomes to each other, we can characterize how COVID-19 is evolving and moving around the world.

In this week's updates, we report:  
### COVID-19 is circulating widely across Europe, with significant movement between countries  
### We identify at least 3 independent transmission chains currently moving across Europe  
### We identify at least 4 introductions to the UK, some with onward community transmission  
### Many introductions into the U.S. to date, resulting in local transmission chains in multiple states  
### Link between the Grand Princess cruise and the ongoing outbreak in Washington state, USA

## Nextstrain narratives

The following pages contain analysis performed using [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org).
Scrolling through the left-hand sidebar will reveal paragraphs of text with a corresponding visualization of the genomic data on the right-hand side.

To have full genomes of a novel and large RNA virus this quickly is a remarkable achievement.
These analyses have been made possible by the rapid and open sharing of genomic data and interpretations by scientists all around the world (see the final slide for a visualization of sequencing authorship).

# [A note about sampling](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-12?c=country&d=map&p=full)
We currently have sequences from samples taken in 30 countries across 5 continents. This is an incredible feat -- sequencing an unknown, large RNA virus in the midst of a pandemic is difficult, and is only possible through the incredible work and timely sharing of data by scientists and physicians around the world.
<br><br>
While this data enables us to infer many useful characteristics of the outbreak and track its spread in real time, it's important to emphasize that our conclusions are limited by the available data. For example, the map shows very few sequences from the global south. This is NOT because COVID-19 isn't circulating in these areas, or that these cases are not as crucial to understand; rather, we just don't have much data available from these areas. The size of each circle on the map indicates how much data is currently available from that area, rather than the true size of the outbreak.

# [Circulation across Europe](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-12?c=country&f_country=Belgium,Finland,France,Germany,Italy,Luxembourg,Netherlands,Portugal,Sweden,Switzerland,United%20Kingdom&label=clade:A2&m=div&p=grid)
Here, we see a large clade of sequences from Europe.
Notably, sequences from many different countries intercalate, indicating that COVID-19 is already circulating quite widely across Europe.
Zooming in on the map, we see that there are many links between Italy and other areas; however, it is important to keep in mind that the directionality of these links can't always be confidently inferred, and other hypotheses that can also explain these data (e.g., if an unsampled case infected both a secondary case sequenced in Italy and a secondary case sequenced elsewhere).

Let's zoom out to start to disentangle this. Here, we can see that within Europe, there are at least 3 active transmission chains -- that is, groups of closely related cases that are all from countries within Europe.

# [Local transmission in the UK](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-12?c=country&d=tree&f_country=United%20Kingdom&p=full)
Looking at the United Kingdom as an example, we can see that this story becomes more complex as we zoom in to more specific areas.
We now have 28 genomes from the United Kingdom; this is consistent with 4 or more introductions from other locations.
The data supports the occurrence of onward community transmission from more than one of these introductions.

# [Introductions to the US](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-12?d=tree,map&f_country=USA&m=div&p=full)
Here, we can see several instances where viruses that are closely related to samples from other countries appear in the U.S.
This indicates that the virus has been introduced to the U.S. on multiple independent occasions.
<br><br>
Most of these introductions aren't associated with any other sampled cases from the U.S., so we're not sure if these introductions led to local outbreaks.
However, given that testing capacity is not yet ramped up in most areas, we expect there are many unreported cases.
<br><br>
For Washington and California, though, we do see clusters of cases that are closely related.
This suggests ongoing transmission and local spread within these two states.

# [Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington state](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-12?label=clade:B1&m=div)
Here, we see a large cluster of cases from Washington that are all closely related.
From this, we conclude that there is extensive local spread within Washington state.
<br><br>
Interestingly, the Washington samples intercalate with samples from the Grand Princess cruise ship.
We aren't sure yet whether the virus spread from the cruise ship to Washington or the other way around; as we get more data, we'll update our analysis.

# [Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in California](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-12?branchLabel=clade&c=num_date&f_division=California&m=div)
Looking at samples from California, we see evidence for multiple introductions.
It's unclear how far the virus has spread in California; we'll give you an update in next week's situation report.

# [Spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Iran](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?label=clade:A3&d=map)
A number of genomes have been sequenced from patients reporting travel history to Iran. These genomes are all extremely similar, and indicate that the outbreak in Iran may be the result of a single transmission which has subsequently been transmitted to many other places. Note that there are no full genomes available from patients in Iran.

# [Takeaways](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-12?c=country&d=map&p=full)
- The virus has been introduced to many parts of the globe multiple times. Not all introductions result in local transmission.  
<br><br>
- We see evidence of local transmission across Europe, parts of the United States, Australia, China, and Southeast Asia.  
<br><br>
- Controlling local outbreaks through social distancing is crucial to protect the vulnerable.

# What you can do  

Social distancing -- that is, decreasing the number of people you encounter each day -- can be challenging, but is hugely beneficial to the public good.  
If everyone decreased their daily contacts by 25%, we would expect to see a 50% decrease in the cumulative number of cases ([Klein et al., 2020-03-10](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/COVID-public/reports/Working%20paper%20%E2%80%93%20model-based%20estimates%20of%20COVID-19%20burden%20in%20King%20and%20Snohomish%20counties%20through%20April%207.pdf)).
<div width="50%">
<img src="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/raw/master/figures/social_distancing_efficacy.png" width="500px">
</div>

## Steps individuals can take
### Reduce the number of people you are in contact with each day, especially if you are in a vulnerable group (e.g., seniors and those with pre-existing conditions)
### Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others
### Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalepeno and have to change a contact lens"  
### Stay home if you are sick; be prepared with a few extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine  
### If you are an employer, encourage your employees to stay home when sick (and financially support them to do so)  

## Steps officials can take  
### Make testing free and broadly available  
### Put social distancing measures in place  
### Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures (e.g., hourly workers, those with elder or childcare responsibilities, small businesses, etc.)

## FAQs & Misconceptions

### FAQs

We know that a lot of people have questions about COVID-19.
We've set up a guide to try and answer some of those most frequently asked [here](https://nextstrain.org/help/coronavirus/FAQ):

</div>


### Misconceptions

A number of misconceptions have been circulated about the origins of the novel coronavirus.
During outbreaks like this one, the spread of information that's known to be incorrect can lead to more panic, and cause people not to trust scientists and governments, meaning they are less likely to follow advisories and take appropriate precautions.

In an effort to try and explain why these views are incorrect, scientists have addressed these theories at the pages below:
